1. Introduction/Business Problem
- In this project, I explore, segment, and cluster the parking lot in the city of Toronto. 
The most common venues will be separated into each cluster of parking in the city.
The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant which will be served for 
a special customer. It can be banker or asian or korean,...

2. Data
- The parking data which is got from toronto open data (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/parking-lot-facilities/)
This dataset includes data on parking lots operated by the City of Toronto PF&R Division. Parking lots are located
in parks or on the building grounds of community centres, schools, pool building, etc. These building or parks are
considered parent assets of parking lots and listed in "Park Name" column.A parking lot has certain number of 
spaces including handicap spots. Every parking lot is identified by (X, Y) GIS coordinate. Parking lots may be 
private, open for public, or used by members/staff only.Parking lot information you'll find in this dataset is the following:
 + Parking Lot Asset ID
 + Park Name
 + Parking Spaces
 + Handicap Parking Spaces
 + GIS Coordinates
 + Access
- I used Foursquare API to get set of the information of venues in the city of Toronto
